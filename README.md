## Setup Notes


1. To start with you can clone, download or copy this repo into an empty folder on your local pc/mac. Make sure that both backend and frontend directories are in this folder, and that
   the files: gitignore, readme and make files are in that one aswell.
2. To run this project you need to run a npm install in both backend and frontend directories. I would start with the backend to see that the server works.
2. After you've done a npm install in backend you can start the server by typing npm run develop in the terminal in the same directory to run strapi and start the server.
3. Once the server is up and running you can go to your frontend directory and first type npm install, and if that works you type gatsby develop to run the site on localhost/8000.
